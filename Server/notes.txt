1. Install virtualenv

    MAC - python3 -m pip install virtualenv
    WIN - py -m pip install vituralenv
-- using python I want to use the models, the one that I want to use is the pip, and I want to install virtualenv

2. Use vituralenv to create a virtual environment

        MAC - python3 -m venv venv
        WIN - py -m venv venv
    venv is the module being used and then the second is the folder name

3. We need to launch the virtualenv

    MAC - source venv/bin/activate
    WIN - (using a forward slash \ which is the uncommon one) venv\Scrpts\activate

4. We need to install flask - this is the server library

    MAC - python3 -m pip install flask
    WIN - py -m pip install flask
     side note - you may need to upgrade pip - upgrade pip


app = Flask(__name__) this has two underscores on each side

5. Start the Flask server
    MAC - python3 server.py
    WIN - py server.py
